**ErgodiX** is a high-performance, hardware-accelerated Python library designed to benchmark state-of-the-art MCMC and diffusion-based sampling algorithms. 

This repository currently features a highly optimized, fully JIT-compiled implementation of **Stochastic Localization via Iterative Posterior Sampling (SLIPS)**, based on the [2024 paper by Grenioux et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10758). 

It is built heavily on `JAX` and `Equinox` to ensure that both the target distributions and the sampling loops can be vectorized and executed flawlessly on GPUs/TPUs.

## 📸 Visuals

Below is an example of the SLIPS algorithm successfully capturing the highly multimodal **8-Gaussians** distribution. Standard local MCMC methods (like MALA or HMC) frequently collapse into a single mode in this scenario.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Hardware Accelerated**: Fully written in JAX. Computations are JIT-compiled (`jax.jit`) and mapped over batches (`jax.vmap`), allowing you to run thousands of chains in parallel.
* **Modular Schedules**: Implement arbitrary noising schedules easily by subclassing the `Schedule` Equinox module.
* **Robust Distribution Library**: Includes challenging benchmark distributions like Funnel, Banana, Rings, Rosenbrock, and high-dimensional Bayesian Logistic Regression (on UCI Sonar and Ionosphere datasets).
* **Strong Typing**: Uses `jaxtyping` extensively for clear, reliable array shapes and types.
* **Built-in Visualization**: Animate samples and particles as they converge over time — in 1D/2D, as N-dimensional projections, or several runs side by side — and export to GIF with `ergodix.visuals`.

## 📦 Installation

To install the package locally, clone the repository and install it via `pip`. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ArthurGilles/ErgodiX.git](https://github.com/ArthurGilles/ErgodiX.git)
cd ErgodiX

# Install core dependencies
pip install -e .

# Install development/testing dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```


# 💻 Quickstart: Sampling with SLIPS

The SLIPS algorithm relies on a predefined noise schedule and relies on MALA (Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm) inner loops to estimate the denoiser. Here is how to sample from a custom distribution in just a few lines of code:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from ergodix.slips import slips, SLIPSParams, GeomSchedule
from ergodix.distributions import IsotropicGaussian

# 1. Set up the random key and target distribution
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
dim = 2
target_dist = IsotropicGaussian(mean=jnp.zeros(dim), std=jnp.ones(dim))

# 2. Configure the scheduling and time grid
schedule = GeomSchedule(alpha_1=1.0, alpha_2=1.0)
time_grid = schedule.get_snr_grid(t_0=0.1, t_end=0.98, steps=20)

# 3. Bundle hyperparameters
params = SLIPSParams(
    sigma=10.0, 
    schedule=schedule,
    n_mcmc_steps=64,
    n_chains=8,
    n_init_steps=64,
    return_history=False
)

# 4. Execute parallel sampling
batch_size = 1000
samples = slips(key, target_dist, time_grid, batch_size, dim, params)

print(f"Generated {samples.shape[0]} samples of dimension {samples.shape[1]}")
```


# 🎬 Visualizing the Sampler

Running SLIPS with `return_history=True` returns the full trajectory of both the **samples**
(`Y_hist`) and the internal **MALA particles** (`X_hist`). The `ergodix.visuals` subpackage turns
these into animations — optionally with the target density overlaid (normalized to total mass 1)
and optionally saved as a GIF.

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from ergodix.slips import slips, SLIPSParams, GeomSchedule
from ergodix.distributions import IsotropicGMM
from ergodix.visuals import animate_samples

# A bimodal target distribution
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
dim = 2
target = IsotropicGMM(
    weights=jnp.array([0.5, 0.5]),
    means=jnp.array([[-2.5, 0.0], [2.5, 0.0]]),
    variances=jnp.array([0.25, 0.25]),
)

schedule = GeomSchedule()
time_grid = schedule.get_snr_grid(t_0=0.1, t_end=0.9, steps=40)

# return_history=True -> (samples, Y_hist, X_hist)
params = SLIPSParams(sigma=1.0, schedule=schedule, return_history=True)
_, y_hist, x_hist = slips(key, target, time_grid, 300, dim, params)

# Samples (left) and particles (right) converging onto the target's level lines,
# saved as a GIF.
animate_samples(
    y_hist, pdf=target, particles=x_hist, time_grid=time_grid, save_path="slips.gif"
)
```

The subpackage exposes three functions:

* `animate_samples` — animate 1D/2D samples over time, with an optional pdf overlay and an optional particle panel.
* `animate_projection` — project N-dimensional samples onto a line or plane, then animate.
* `compare_samples` — compare several runs side by side, with time advancing at the same speed for all of them.

See [`src/ergodix/visuals/README.md`](src/ergodix/visuals/README.md) for more examples.

# 🗂️ Project Architecture

The codebase is organized into three primary subpackages:


1. `nano_sampler_jax.distribution`

An object-oriented collection of target distributions inheriting from TargetDistribution (an equinox.Module).

- Toy 2D Geometries: `Banana`, `Rings`, `Rosenbrock`

- High-Dimensional Benchmarks: `Funnel` (Neal, 2003), `IsotropicGaussian`

- Mixture Models: `IsotropicGMM`, `FullCovGMM`

- Real-world Posteriors: `BayesianLogisticRegression` (with utility loaders for UCI datasets)

You can define your own distributions by making them inherit from the `TargetDistribution` class and overiding the `__call__` method:

```python
from jaxtyping import Array, Float
from ergodix.distributions import TargetDistribution

class MyDistribution(TargetDistribution):
    param_1: float = 0.0
    param_2: float = 1.0
    
    def __call__(self, x: Float[Array, "2"]) -> Float[Array, ""]:        
        return ...
```

2. `nano_sampler_jax.slips`

The core implementation of the SLIPS algorithm.

- `slips.py`: Contains the _single_slips logic and the vectorized, JIT-compiled slips wrapper. Utilizes jax.lax.scan and jax.lax.fori_loop for strict compilation.

- `mala.py`: The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin step logic used to estimate the SLIPS denoiser.

- `schedules.py`: Contains `StandardSchedule` and `GeomSchedule ` definitions to construct the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) grids.

- `params.py`: The `SLIPSParams` dataclass for organizing sampler hyperparameters (step sizes, burn-in ratios, chain counts).

3. `ergodix.visuals`

Animation utilities to visualize sampler output over time (built on `matplotlib`, a core dependency).

- `samples.py`: `animate_samples` — animates 1D/2D samples over time, with an optional pdf overlay (normalized to mass 1) and an optional second panel for the SLIPS particles (`X_hist`).

- `projection.py`: `animate_projection` — projects N-dimensional samples onto a user-provided line or plane before animating.

- `comparison.py`: `compare_samples` — compares several sample sets (or `(samples, particles)` pairs) side by side, driven by a single shared time clock.

All three return a `matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation` and can export a GIF (or MP4) through `save_path`. See [`src/ergodix/visuals/README.md`](src/ergodix/visuals/README.md) for runnable examples.

# 🧪 Running Tests

The repository is fully unit-tested using pytest. The test suite validates gradients, shapes, edge-cases for schedules, and end-to-end execution of the SLIPS algorithm.

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
